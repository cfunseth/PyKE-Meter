# pyke-meter
Python/Pygame interface and 3D models for replicating the PKE meter from the Real Ghostbusters.

The project is currently being developed for a Raspberry Pi Zero running Rasbian Stretch Lite (10-09-2018).

## Anticipated Project Structure:

### Source Code

* pkeScreen.py - Executes main PyKE code
* media - Folder containing all images and audio files for use with source code

### 3D Files

* STLs and assembly instructions of the 3D PKE model

### Schematics  
* Diagrams and drawings for the various connections and circuits associated with the project

## To Do:

* Finalize 3D models for printing
* Develop source code (currently have a basic screen and motor code implimented)
* requirements.txt - For use with pip to install required dependencies
